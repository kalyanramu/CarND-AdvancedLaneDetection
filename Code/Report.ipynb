    "Radial Distortion is caused due to the spherical shape of lens. This is because light travelling through center of lens doesn't get bent due to refraction.

    "Also, to improve localizing the lanes we will be using our problem specific color thresholding. For color we simply convert the frame to HLS color space and apply a threshold on the S channel.
